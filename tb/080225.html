                <b>T</b>oday I sat down to do more software...<br>
                <b>I</b> finished the course work yesterday.. The course work that was meant to take me 2 weeks.. Whoops. <br>
                <b>I</b> sat down to continue building my GitHub.io page. As I was progressively getting more and more agitated about the css file not working- It turns out that I had written stylesheets, rather than stylesheet. After fixing the issue I have been getting further along. Then I started to think about the design piece. How big do I want the text font. And wondered if there was a way to build it responsively. It turns out that you can build elements depending on the vw (view width) and the vh (view height). Meaning that you can build something that’s responsive to the screen size that it’s on. <br>
                <b>T</b>he trouble was when it was nicely sized on my computer, resizing it for a mobile phone it became much too small. <br>
                <b>W</b>hich is where I’m thinking about putting some logic. <br>
                
                <b>G</b>ive it a vw until a certain px as a minimum. That way if someone looks at it on a tv it will size up nicely. But on the phone it will still be around readable size. <br>
                
                <b>I</b> went through a range of different videos with big questions on my mind...<br>
                <br><b>I</b> spent almost 3 hours going from video to video and didn’t learn what I had wanted to. The video title appeared to touch on the topic, but the actual content of the video didn’t. And videos don’t often give you a heading of where they’re going or what they’re doing. Meaning that you almost have to sit and watch the whole thing in order to understand the context. <br>
                <br>
                <b>I</b> realise that this feels disappointing, and isn’t something I really enjoy. I am going to start towards learning how to read documentation. As this gives titles. You can skim it and come back over it. And it gives you its context.  <br>
