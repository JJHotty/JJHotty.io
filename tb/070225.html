                <b>I</b> sat down a few hours ago to start going through the prep work for the Dev academy start.. <br>
<b>A</b>fter going at it for a few hours the idea came up about keeping a diary of the things that you learn.. Writing it out in a layman’s terms. Almost as if to translate what you have learned and transpose it in a new way for your brain to soak it up and really learn the content. <br>
<b>I</b>t suggested to do it in various moments throughout the day and also at the end. Both giving light to the whole days achievements, and the particular tasks- even portions of the tasks completed.<br>
 <b>A</b>nd how you felt that you did with the task. What was your participation? Who were you through the task? What did you learn? What did you do wrong? What will you do tomorrow?<br><br>
<b>T</b>he studies went on to talk about Neuroplacisty. The idea that your brain is capable of making new connections. Building strong highways that information travels down. We need a growth mindset to be truly successful. 
A mindset that says ‘Even though this problem feels bigger than my current understanding, this is fun and I can learn to beat it’! <br><br>
<b>T</b>hen the studies went on to talk about time management. 
And the article had four major questions to ask yourself within a day. 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening.<br>
<br>
<i><strong>Reflection questions to ask yourself:</strong></Reflection></i>
<br>What are my goals today? <br>

<br>What are my challenges today?<br>
<br>Have I reached my goals for today?<br>
<br>What have I learned today?<br>
