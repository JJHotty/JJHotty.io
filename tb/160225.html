                <b>T</b>he last couple weeks have been a blast! <br>
                <br>
                <b>A</b>s someone who has attempted to learn development before on their own and lost their way- This course really excites me! <br>
                <b>I</b> think the thing that excites me the most about this whole endeavour is that someone else is pacing the course for me. - Up to this point I would pace unsettlingly large goals and work myself into a trance state where all I can think about are numbers and functions.. I start to lose sleep and before I know it.. I'm so burned out that I put boundaries in place and leave the code behind.<br>
                <b>B</b>ut I really do love to learn, love to push my brain and solve issues. Just sometimes I can be a little harsh.<br>
                <br>
                <b>T</b>he past couple days have been spent dipping my toes into javascript! I've gone over the basics of variables, operators, loops, functions, strings, events, maths, dates and if-else logic. <br>
                <b>I</b>'ve really loved every bit of it and can't wait till the first assignment.<br><br>
