                <b>A</b> while ago I tried to teach myself programming. Along that journey I cam accross some amazing resources and I have written them all down here:<br>
        Here are all the links from the old Mac related to web and software...<br></p>

<b>T</b>o me, these are incredibly important web links to blogs and YouTubers that have based my learning through the odin project thus far. 
They were on my old Mac which I had to dust off and log into. It used a program called synergy by symless to get all typed out on my new mac. <br><br>

<b>T</b>oday I learned about memorisation. The idea of linking a memory to something that relates deeper to me. Such as trying to learn a fella’s name baker. It would be easier to learn his job as a baker- Because we can think about the way he might smell, what he wears as a baker, the types of foods we like that he might make. Word association is a really helpful way to memorise words and concepts. <br>
<br>
<b>I</b> also downloaded a couple more tools to the Mac in preparation for the course ahead.<br>

<b>T</b>he other thing I watched was a ted talk that talked about the benefits of taking small steps in order to make strong habits. <br>
<b>T</b>rying to achieve something by just jumping towards that thing doesn’t always go a long way. But leaning into the idea that you could floss one tooth and that would start your habit. And then next time at the same time or after the same thing. <br>

<b>C</b>ontinuing on... Floss 2 teeth and eventually you’ll have an established habit that is easier to hold onto. <br>
<b>T</b>he same idea of trying to just immediately run a marathon. You’ll maybe try it once and think that I can’t even do this. But first walk out the door and back in each day. Then walk to the end of the street and back. Jog to the end of the street. Walk around the block. Jog around the block. And eventually run.. 
<br><b>S</b>lowly increasing in cadence and distance. But always remembering to factor it into forming a habit. Do it every day and work towards giving it a trigger. ie. After I have dinner I always go outside. This will mean that you will be able to get started without much effort.. <br>
<b>Y</b>ou’re not immediately running a marathon. You are just walking outside which isn’t hard, and doesn’t take much time. And you work up to the point.
